# bugme - Open bugs in BMO
Web extension (written for Firefox) to open things-that-are-likely-bug-numbers in bugzilla.mozilla.org.

This is a simple extension that provides the ability, via context menu, to open things that "look like" bug numbers in the selected text in bugzilla, either as a single bug or as a group. In this context, "look like" means a regex match of 4-7 digits.

This is useful for when someone has not linked a bug number in some context (which happens in my world a lot).
